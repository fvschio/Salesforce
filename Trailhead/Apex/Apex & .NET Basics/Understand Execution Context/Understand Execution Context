Write an Apex trigger that modifies Account fields before inserting records.
Write an Apex trigger that fires before records are inserted and ensures that the ShippingState field has the same value as the BillingState field.
Create an Apex class that contains a public static method:
Name: AccountTriggerHandler
Method name: CreateAccounts
The method must accept a List of Account objects
For each Account record, before saving, ensure that the ShippingState field has the same value as the BillingState field
Create an Apex Trigger:
Name: AccountTrigger
sObject: Account
Fires: before records are inserted
Your trigger must call the AccountTriggerHandler.CreateAccounts() method with the collection of new records
Use the isBefore and isInsert trigger context variables
Create a test class:
Name: AccountTriggerTest
Your test class must insert 200 Account records with a BillingState of CA
After the insert, test to ensure that all 200 records have a ShippingState of CA
Before verifying this challenge, run your test class at least once using the Developer Console Run All feature
