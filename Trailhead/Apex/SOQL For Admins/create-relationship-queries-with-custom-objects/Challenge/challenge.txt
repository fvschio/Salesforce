Create a Relationship Query
Use SOQL to identify properties listed with DreamHouse Realty in the last 30 days.

If you didn’t already install the DreamHouse package and import sample data, follow the instructions at the beginning of this unit to do that now.

Create a class
Name: PropertyUtility
Create a method
Name: newListedProperties
Keywords: public, static, and void
Create a list
Name: newPropList
Create a query and assign the query results to the list
Get this information:
The name of the property
The broker’s email address
How long the property has been on market
(Hint: Use API names, not field names or field labels)
Object: Property
Condition: The property was listed within the last 30 days
Create a for loop that iterates through the query results
Object: Property
List name: newPropList
For each item, concatenate the property name, followed by a colon, followed by the broker’s email address: <Property Name> : <Broker Email>
Store the concatenated string in a variable named propEmail
Print the propEmail variable to the debug log
