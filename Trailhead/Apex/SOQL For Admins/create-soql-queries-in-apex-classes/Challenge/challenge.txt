Create a for loop to iterate through a SOQL query
Write a query to get the name and annual revenue of all accounts. Then use a for loop to iterate through each account, printing the name and annual revenue of each account to the debug log.
Create a class
Name: AccountUtility
Create a method
Name: viewAnnualRevenue
Keywords: public, static, and void
Create a list
Name: accountsList
Create a query and assign the results to a list
Fields: Account Name and Annual Revenue (Hint: Use API names, not field names or labels)

Create a for loop that iterates through the query results
Object: Account
List name: accountsList
For each item, concatenate the account name, followed by a colon, followed by the accountâ€™s annual revenue: <Account Name> : <Annual Revenue>
Store the concatenated string in a variable named acctRev
Print the acctRev variable to the debug log
