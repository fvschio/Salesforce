Create an Apex class with a method that returns a list of strings
Create an Apex class with a method that returns a list of formatted strings. The length of the list is determined by an integer parameter. You can also use an array if you prefer, but these instructions assume youâ€™re using a list.
The Apex class must be called StringArrayTest and be in the public scope
The Apex class must have a public static method called generateStringArray
The generateStringArray method must return a list of strings
The method must accept an incoming Integer as a parameter, which will be used to determine the number of returned strings
The method must return a list of strings. Each element in the list must have the format Test n, where n is the index of the current string in the list. For example, if the input is 3, then the output should be ['Test 0', 'Test 1', 'Test 2']. Remember that in Apex, the index position of the first element in a list is always 0
